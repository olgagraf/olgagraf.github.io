The theory of neural networks revolves around the fact that the neural networks are universal approximators. That it, **for any continuous function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large f"> defined on a bounded domain, we can find a neural network that approximates <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large f"> with an arbitrary degree of accuracy**.

However, it is not widely understood why this holds true. Available literature on the topic tends towards two extremes. On one hand, there are simple visual explanations like the one given by Michael Nielsen [[1]](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap4.html), with plausible, but not mathematically rigorous arguments. On the other hand, there are scientific papers with lengthy proofs which require a solid mathematical background.

In this note, a simple yet mathematically rigorous explanation is presented. In order to read the text, it will suffice to have basic knowledge of calculus and linear algebra. For the sake of simplicity, some statements will be presented without a proof, in this case an intuitive explanation will be provided. However, an overall argument does not give up on rigour and follows a mathematically elegant as well as historically important proof given by George Cybenko in 1989 [[2]](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cscott/smlrg/approx_by_superposition.pdf).

## The Formal Statement
Let us start with defining our neural network and formalizing the theorem statement. 

We consider a feedforward network with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large n"> neurons in the input layer, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large m"> neurons in the hidden layer, a single neuron in the output layer and some activation function <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Large \phi"> (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU). We can write it down in a compact way,

where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%5CLarge+%5Cdisplaystyle+%5Cmathbf%7Bw%7D_i%2C+%5Cmathbf%7Bx%7D+%5Cin+%5Cmathbb%7BR%7D%5En">,
