Welcome fellow beings to the binary world of the other side! 

The 21st century has been a wild drive and twenty 1 years of riding the wave has made me realized that I'm just a speck in a universe far greater than great could ever be.

Being a wonderjunkie, I would like to capture my jumping, raging and calming thoughts of my everyday learnings and mistakes. 

Technology is indeed seeping in everything we do, interact with, listen to and watch. Such a powerful tool must be leveraged but in a responsible way.

With that, I would like for you to see some of my horrendously witten posts with bad grammar and reach out to me with English lessons. 

In turn, I would love to barter with you some of the tech knowledge I possess. 

I wish you fare well being.
