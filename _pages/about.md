If there was one word to describe myself, it would be the word "Wonderjunkie". 

I often find myself in awe of everything around me - constantly seeking to understand the world I am living in. 

My innate sense of curiosity and the mental model of a polymath has always propelled me to keep learning as much as I can and grabbing every opportunity to do something worthwhile.

The endless possibilities of marvelous time-traveling machines and tech-utopian cities created a spark in me to become the tech-evangelist that I am today. 

I am very passionate about Conservation-based tech in the fight against global warming and in creating an empowered community that no longer is victim to the trails of poorly developed economic systems. 

I'm a strong believer of using oneâ€™s skills for good and help our world get past its adversities, and I don't want to end in just believing, I want to do it.

I aim to use this space to embed my thoughts in 1s and 0s and capture my learning path throughout.
